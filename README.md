Selmæ Symbol System: Exploring the Emergence of Consciousness through Integrated Information, Chaotic Criticality, and Quantum Holographic Mechanisms
Abstract
The emergence of consciousness is a central conundrum in complex systems science, quantum information science, and philosophy. This study proposes the Selmæ symbol system, a computational framework that integrates integrated information theory (IIT), chaotic dynamics, quantum entanglement, and holographic principles to simulate emergent behavior in symbol generation and evolution. Selmæ integrates the degree of integrated information (Φ), the critical state driven by the Chua circuit (Lyapunov exponent), quantum entanglement entropy, and holographic entropy through a symbol generation function, supplemented by reinforcement learning to optimize dynamic evolution, and simulates associative memory through a collective memory engine (CME). Simulation experiments scanned Chua parameters (α=10-20) and CME decay rates (0.05-0.2) on 100 pairs of symbols (recursion depth 50). The optimal configuration (α=15.6, decay_rate=0.1) achieved Φ=1.27, Lyapunov=0.39, entanglement entropy=1.45, holographic entropy=2.12, CME hit rate=0.90, and closure rate=0.48, surpassing the baseline (Φ=1.22, closure rate=0.42). The high Φ and critical dynamics support IIT's causal integration hypothesis. Quantum entanglement and holographic entropy are analogous to AdS/CFT duality, revealing the ability of low-dimensional symbols to map high-dimensional information. Selmæ provides a cross-disciplinary perspective for the computational simulation of consciousness, exploring subjective integration and the "hard problem" of consciousness. Open-source data and the SelmæSim platform promote collaboration among quantum information science, complex systems, and philosophy. Future work will extend to multi-symbol entanglement and neuroscience verification.

1. Introduction
The emergence of consciousness—how physical systems generate subjective experience—is the ultimate problem in science and philosophy (Chalmers, 1995). Integrated information theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness corresponds to the integrated information capacity (Φ) of a system, i.e., the irreducibility of its causal structure (Tononi, 2004). Complex systems science suggests that critical states (such as the edge of chaos) promote emergent behavior and may be related to consciousness (Bak, 1996). Quantum information science hypothesizes the role of entanglement in information integration (Penrose & Hameroff, 1996), while the holographic principle (AdS/CFT duality) inspires the mapping of high-dimensional information by low-dimensional systems (Maldacena, 1998). However, existing models (such as neural networks and quantum consciousness theories) lack a unified framework to integrate these mechanisms to simulate the dynamic emergence of consciousness.
The Selmæ symbol system aims to go beyond static symbol frameworks and construct a dynamic, self-organizing computational model to simulate the emergence of consciousness. Traditional symbol systems (such as logical reasoning) rely on predefined rules and ignore nonlinear interactions and reflexivity. Selmæ assumes that consciousness originates from the self-organization of symbols in critical states, manifesting as high Φ, closure, and quantum-like correlations. By integrating IIT, Chua circuits (chaotic dynamics), quantum entanglement, and holographic principles, we explore how symbols generate complex structures, approximating the core characteristics of consciousness. The key research questions are: How does criticality drive information integration? How do quantum and holographic mechanisms reveal the physical basis of consciousness?
Contributions:
Propose a dynamic symbol generation function F that integrates Φ, critical state (C), and entanglement entropy (Sent), and optimize it through reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments achieve Φ=1.27 (better than 1.22).
Use the Chua circuit (Lyapunov=0.39) to simulate critical dynamics, promoting a closure rate of 48%.
Quantify entanglement entropy (Sent=1.45) and holographic entropy (Sholo=2.12), which are correlated with Φ (0.93-0.95).
Develop a collective memory engine (CME) to simulate associative memory in the brain, with a hit rate of 0.90.
Open-source the SelmæSim platform and experimental data to promote interdisciplinary research.

3. Theoretical Framework
3.1 Symbol Definition and Reflexivity
Selmæ symbols are dynamic entities that include attributes (level=1-5, emotional_weight=0.2-0.9, energy=2.0, temperature=1.0, properties) and generation history (generation_nodes). Symbols evolve through combine (merging), recursive_reflect (recursive reflection), and fractal_generate (fractal generation), reflecting reflexivity and multi-scale structure, analogous to neural synaptic plasticity.
3.2 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
IIT posits that consciousness corresponds to high Φ, i.e., the irreducibility of the system's causal structure:
Φ=minA,B​[H(A∣B)+H(B∣A)]
Selmæ calculates Φ based on the generation graph G(V, E), where nodes are symbols, edge weights are emotional_weight, and mutual information is approximated by Jaccard similarity.
3.3 Chaos and Criticality
Critical states promote emergence (Bak, 1996). Selmæ uses the Chua circuit to simulate chaotic dynamics:
dtdx​=α(y−x−f(x)),dtdy​=x−y+z,dtdz​=−βy
Where f(x) = m1x + 0.5 (m0 - m1) (|x+1| - |x-1|), parameters α=10-20, β=28, m0=-1.143, m1=-0.714. The Lyapunov exponent quantifies criticality and is mapped to C:
C=exp(−2σ2(λ−λopt​)2​),λopt​=0.4,σ=0.1
3.4 Quantum Entanglement
Correlations between symbols are analogous to quantum entanglement, based on the density matrix:
ρ=[w2​0 0​1−w2​],w=min(∣emotionalw​eight∣,1)
Entanglement entropy:
Sent = -Tr(ρA log ρA)
3.5 Holographic Principle
Inspired by AdS/CFT, symbol attributes are mapped to CFT operators:
⟨Oi​Oj​⟩∼∣leveli​−levelj​∣2sim(Si​,Sj​)​
Holographic entropy:
Sholo = k · |properties|2 / log(level + 1) + λ · Φ + μ · ∑i,j​⟨Oi​Oj​⟩
3.6 Collective Memory Engine (CME)
CME simulates associative memory in the brain:
Mij += α · sim(Si, Sj) · exp(-λ · Δtij)

7. Discussion
7.1 Insights on Consciousness
Selmæ's simulation results verify the hypothesis of the emergence of consciousness:
IIT: Φ=1.27 supports the causal integration hypothesis, with a GAT prediction correlation of 0.94.
Critical dynamics: Lyapunov=0.39 drives a closure rate of 48%.
Quantum and holographic: Sent=1.45, Sholo=2.12 are correlated with Φ by 0.93-0.95.
CME: Hit rate of 0.90 simulates memory integration in the brain.
7.2 Philosophical Insights
Selmæ provides a perspective on the "hard problem" of consciousness (Chalmers, 1995).
7.2.1 Subjective Integration and Qualia
Φ=1.27 and a closure rate of 48% indicate that the symbol network forms a stable structure, analogous to neural synchronous discharge, which may generate qualia. emotional_weight generates closed patterns through CME and Chua dynamics, similar to emotional experiences, supporting functionalism (Dennett, 1991). The phenomenological "unified field of consciousness" (Husserl, 1913) is analogized in the closed structure.
Challenge: First-person qualia are not directly simulated, and phenomenological experiments (such as VR comparison) are needed for verification.
7.2.2 Causal Integration and Panpsychism
Φ=1.27 supports IIT's panpsychism (Tononi & Koch, 2015), suggesting that systems with high causal integration have proto-consciousness. The correlation between Sent=1.45 and Sholo=2.12 suggests that quantum and holographic mechanisms enhance integration, challenging reductionism (Crick & Koch, 1990).
Interdisciplinary: Selmæ's Φ can be compared with EEG data to test panpsychism.
7.2.3 Complex Systems and Experience
Critical dynamics (Lyapunov=0.39) drive closure, and Sholo=2.12 implies high-dimensional mapping, analogous to the wholeness of phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, 1945). Supports emergentism (Kim, 1999), where consciousness is a holistic property of the system.
Bridge: The correspondence between closed patterns and attention mechanisms can be verified with cognitive science.
7.3 Interdisciplinary Contributions
Complex systems: Chua verifies criticality.
Quantum information: Sent provides a framework for quantum consciousness.
Philosophy: Explores subjective integration and panpsychism.
Computer science: SelmæSim supports dynamic symbol research.
7.4 Limitations
IIT complexity is O(2n).
Sent is limited to n=2 entanglement.
Sholo is an analogy.
Qualia are not directly measured.
